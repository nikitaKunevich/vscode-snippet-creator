# snippet-creator README

(Ths extension is deprecated.
Looking for a new maintainer.)

This extension helps to automate snippet creation. Select text you want to create snippet from and use command "Create snippet" from command palette.

You can edit created snippets as usual because snippets created by this extension simply get added to the snippet JSON file for the relevant language. Use the command Preferences: Configure User Snippets (a built-in vscode command) to select and edit your snippets file.
